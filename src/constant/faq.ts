      question: "What is SKE?",
      answer:
        'Software and Knowledge Engineering or SKE (pronounce "ski") for short, is a branch in a Computer Engineering, Kasetsart University. Our branch is also a part of the international Undergraduate Program (IUP).',
    },
    {
      question: "What are the required courses for this branch?",
      answer:
        'For freshmen it is required to learn the general engineering courses such as "Engineering Mathematics I", "General Physics I" and "Physics Lab I". You will also need to apply for essential Computer Engineering courses such as, "Computer Programming I" and "Discrete Mathematics and Algebra". For Computer Programming I, you will get to learn the fundamentals of programming with Python. For Discrete Mathematics and Algebra, you will learn about the basic of discrete mathematics and algebra, which is essential for programming.',
    },
    {
      question: "Are the courses difficult?",
      answer:
        "The difficulty of each course varies on each learner, it depends on whether you have basics or not. You might need to adjust and may have to work harder than others, also try to learn by yourself and practice doing exercises.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is a computer required? What about specifications?",
      answer:
        "A computer is required though it is REALLY recommended to have a laptop. Portable computers will make your life easier and should always be taken to university. For Windows, you should pick a laptop with medium specs such as Core i5 or Ryzen 5 CPU, 8GB RAM, 512 HDD. Make sure to get the latest generation of CPU to have faster performance. For Mac, it is recommended to get at least M1 CPU.",
